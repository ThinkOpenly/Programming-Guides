# OpenPOWER Foundation Documentation Development Guide
This repository holds the source for the documentation development guide 
(formerly *Master Template Document*) for 
OpenPOWER Foundation. The PDF and HTML generated from the doc/template/ 
directory build a document that both describes how to build a new
document and contains examples and directions on how to do it.

To build this project, one must ensure that the Docs-Master project has
also been cloned at the same directory level as the Docs-Template project.
This can be accomplished with the following steps:

1. Clone the master documentation project (Docs-Master) using the following command:

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/OpenPOWERFoundation/Docs-Master.git
  ```
  
2. Clone this project (Docs-Template) using the following command:

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/OpenPOWERFoundation/Docs-Template.git
  ```
  
3. Build the project with these commands:
  ```
  $ cd Docs-Template
  $ mvn clean generate-sources
  ```

The online version of the document can be found in the OpenPOWER Foundation
Document library at [OpenPOWER Foundation Documentation Development Guide](http://openpowerfoundation.org/?resource_lib=openpower-foundation-documentation-development-guide).

The project which controls the look and feel of the document is the 
[Docs-Maven-Plugin project](https://github.com/OpenPOWERFoundation/Docs-Maven-Plugin), an 
OpenPOWER Foundation private project on GitHub.  To obtain access to the Maven Plugin project, 
contact Jeff Scheel \([scheel@us.ibm.com](mailto://scheel@us.ibm.com)\) or
